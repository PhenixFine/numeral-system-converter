# numeral-system-converter
Stage 6 of 6 for JetBrains Academy - Kotlin - [Numeral System Converte project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/107).  
The program has us convert from one number system to another. Stage six just has us catch any errors and print "error" so I'm including the requirements for Stage 5 instead of Stage 6.
### Requirements Stage 5
